# Squidski's CSGO VMF Files
Welcome to a repository containing map files for maps I made around 2015-2018 (featuring some other stuff too).
In general, the usage of the files in this repository is simple. You can use them to make modified version of my maps,
or anything like that. Really the only thing you can't do with anything in this repository is anything that would fall
into the realm of "commercial use". These VMFs are primarily for learning, but if anyone wants to make a modification
of one of these maps for fun, they can.

Also, this repository doesn't contain any assets. So if you would like the custom assets from these maps, you will have
to download them from the workshop and extract the assets yourself. Any assets referenced in these files that aren't
contained in the Workshop BSPs are probably also unfortunately lost to me, so we are both out of luck.

Without further ado, here are the descriptions of the files in this repository.

## Expedited & Expedited 2
Expedited was the first map I ever made for CSGO, back in 2015. Obviously this is no masterpiece but it did get me started in mapping.
Basically all of the geometry here is laughable and it plays horribly

I did a "remake" of this map in 2018 featuring newer assets, but there's really nothing to write home about here. Plays just as bad, probably.

## Final Stop
Final Stop was my second map for CSGO, and very clearly more ambitious. It was also made in 2015. It was never playtested and probably plays awfully.

## Reserve
Reserve was the third map I made for CSGO (also in 2015). At this point in time I felt pretty profient with the tools, so when I got the
idea for this map while at school, it only took me a few days to really get this map in the state it currently exists in.
I was pretty proud for getting this map made so quickly, but the layout is really really really weird. Surprisingly, it was never playtested.

## Cantaloupe
Cantaloupe was my 4th CSGO map, and more or less the last one before my 2 year mapping hiatus from 2016 - 2018. This level is optimized
absolutely awfully, and it was also never playtested. At the time though, I considered this my magnum opus because I really liked the A site.
And honestly, I still think it has some cool ideas that could maybe work in a wingman map. Though will likely never end up doing that, just
a neat thought.

## Belagerung
Belagerung was a map I made after being inspired by Neuschwanstein when I visited Germany. I was extremely proud of this map at the time,
and to be honest looking back at it now, I do think it was pretty impressive that I actually finished a project of this size with how
inexperienced I was. Seeking some help on some technical stuff for this map is what led me to join the Source Engine discord, and the overall
mapping community at-large. For all intents and purposes, this is where my mapping career really got pushed to the next level.

Also: the optimization on this map is awful

## Hustle
Hustle was my first foray into hostage maps. I made it around 2018-ish, because I thought the architecture on one of the buildings
at my university was cool. This was also the first map I made that I got officially playtested. It was absolutely awful and I never
touched it after the first playtest. Still had some cool ideas though.

No workshop link because I deleted it :(

## The Spooky Manor
The Spooky Manor was a map I made for the Source Engine Discord wingman contest in 2018. I put a ton of work into this, and challenged
myself a ton which led me to learning so much over the course of this project. It also taught me to actually test layouts, as this
played awfully and ranked really really low for gameplay. After this map though, I got inspired to work on bigger projects and collaborate
for the first time.

In late 2019, about a year after the contest, I felt the need to prove to myself that I could make it a lot better. I do feel like I succeeded in
this when I turned it into a wingman hostage map and redid a lot of the art. Its not perfect but it is CLEARLY much improved over the contest 
version, just showing how much knowledge I gained in a year.

This folder contains the original beta which was probably last saved a few months before the deadline (wm_halloween), the contest version (de_spookymanor),
and the hostage version (cs_spookymanor)

## Gongji
Gongji was what I consider my first "real" 5v5 map I ever made. I really challenged myself on this and at the time was
pretty happy with the project. There are obviously things I would have done very differently in hindsight, but it is what it is.
This is effectively the map that caused me to start teaching myself how to 3d model, which nowadays feels like my most
honed skill in level design/env art.

This map was made for the Mapcore Exotic Places mapping contest. The contest version is (I believe) de_gongji.vmf, while the 
layout rework I did for the Mapcore Hubs is called de_gongji_reborn.vmf.

## Analog
Analog was a little wingman experiment I tried out in 2020. I based it off of a real life building I liked the look of.
We playtested it, it played pretty horribly. I tried to fit a good wingman map in the confines of this building but I just couldn't do it,
so this is effectively dead. Doubt I will ever revisit.
