Expedited was the first map I ever made for CSGO, back in 2015. Obviously this is no masterpiece but it did get me started in mapping.
Basically all of the geometry here is laughable and it plays horribly

I did a "remake" of this map in 2018 featuring newer assets, but there's really nothing to write home about here. Plays just as bad, probably.
