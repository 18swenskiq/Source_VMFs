Hustle was my first foray into hostage maps. I made it around 2018-ish, because I thought the architecture on one of the buildings
at my university was cool. This was also the first map I made that I got officially playtested. It was absolutely awful and I never
touched it after the first playtest. Still had some cool ideas though.

No workshop link because I deleted it :(
