Belagerung was a map I made after being inspired by Neuschwanstein when I visited Germany. I was extremely proud of this map at the time,
and to be honest looking back at it now, I do think it was pretty impressive that I actually finished a project of this size with how
inexperienced I was. Seeking some help on some technical stuff for this map is what led me to join the Source Engine discord, and the overall
mapping community at-large. For all intents and purposes, this is where my mapping career really got pushed to the next level.

Also: the optimization on this map is awful
