Analog was a little wingman experiment I tried out in 2020. I based it off of a real life building I liked the look of.
We playtested it, it played pretty horribly. I tried to fit a good wingman map in the confines of this building but I just couldn't do it,
so this is effectively dead. Doubt I will ever revisit.
