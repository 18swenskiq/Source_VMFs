Cantaloupe was my 4th CSGO map, and more or less the last one before my 2 year mapping hiatus from 2016 - 2018. This level is optimized
absolutely awfully, and it was also never playtested. At the time though, I considered this my magnum opus because I really liked the A site.
And honestly, I still think it has some cool ideas that could maybe work in a wingman map. Though will likely never end up doing that, just
a neat thought.
