Reserve was the third map I made for CSGO (also in 2015). At this point in time I felt pretty profient with the tools, so when I got the
idea for this map while at school, it only took me a few days to really get this map in the state it currently exists in.
I was pretty proud for getting this map made so quickly, but the layout is really really really weird. Surprisingly, it was never playtested.
