The Spooky Manor was a map I made for the Source Engine Discord wingman contest in 2018. I put a ton of work into this, and challenged
myself a ton which led me to learning so much over the course of this project. It also taught me to actually test layouts, as this
played awfully and ranked really really low for gameplay. After this map though, I got inspired to work on bigger projects and collaborate
for the first time.

In late 2019, about a year after the contest, I felt the need to prove to myself that I could make it a lot better. I do feel like I succeeded in
this when I turned it into a wingman hostage map and redid a lot of the art. Its not perfect but it is CLEARLY much improved over the contest 
version, just showing how much knowledge I gained in a year.

This folder contains the original beta which was probably last saved a few months before the deadline (wm_halloween), the contest version (de_spookymanor),
and the hostage version (cs_spookymanor)
