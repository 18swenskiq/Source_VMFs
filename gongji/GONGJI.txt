Gongji was what I consider my first "real" 5v5 map I ever made. I really challenged myself on this and at the time was
pretty happy with the project. There are obviously things I would have done very differently in hindsight, but it is what it is.
This is effectively the map that caused me to start teaching myself how to 3d model, which nowadays feels like my most
honed skill in level design/env art.

This map was made for the Mapcore Exotic Places mapping contest. The contest version is (I believe) de_gongji.vmf, while the 
layout rework I did for the Mapcore Hubs is called de_gongji_reborn.vmf.
